# Cloop Python End

How to set this up:

run ```python3 -m venv venv```

if it doesnt work, close the app and open it again. I wish I was joking too.

then depending on what OS you are running, choose the next command very very carefully.

If you are on MacOS or Linux (YOTL!!), please run
```source venv/bin/activate```

If you are on Windows, please run ```venv\Scripts\Activate```

Then, run  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Please do this in VS Code I havent tested this in PyCharm yet thankyeww
